Summary     : A Basic interpreter and compiler with graphics capabilities
Description :

  X11-Basic is a dialect of the BASIC programming language with graphics
  capability that integrates features like shell scripting, cgi-Programming and
  full graphical visualisation into the easy to learn basic language on modern
  computers.

  The structure of the language is similar to the ATARI-ST GFA-BASIC.
 
  This package includes the basic interpreter named xbasic and a set of
  different  compilers. The interpreter can be used as a shell, and can so run
  basic-scripts. You can make excecutable scripts p.ex. *.cgi-Scripts for
  handling web-input. 

  A compiler (xbc) is included which makes stand alone binaries out of the
  scripts, which run more than 10 times faster than the interpreted code. The
  compiler can either pseudo-compile the X11-Basic  sources by attaching the
  source to a run-only interpreter (in which case the  program will not run
  faster than is the interpreter is used, but you have everything in one
  excecutable file), or the compiler can do a real compilation of the BASIC
  source into bytecode, then C, and finally machine language. This way the code
  excecutes  about 10 times faster.

  X11-Basic programs can also be compiled into a bytecode (see xbbc). This
  bytecode  can be interpreted by a virtual machine (see xbvm). Finally, the
  bytecode can be  converted to C sourcefiles (see xb2c) which can be compiled
  with the gnu C compiler (or the tiny C compiler) to native excecutables.

  Ancient ANSI-Basic programs (with line numbers) can be converted to X11-Basic
  with the bas2x11basic program (see the man page bas2x11basic(1) ).


  X11BASIC is free software and comes with NO WARRANTY - read the file
  COPYING for details
 
  (Basically that means, free, open source, use and modify as you like, don't
  incorporate it into non-free software, no warranty of any sort, don't blame me
  if it doesn't work.)

Please read the file INSTALL for compiling instructions.

regards and have fun
